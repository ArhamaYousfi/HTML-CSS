   <h1>PIAIC</h1>

   <h2>PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING</h2>
   <P>Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded not-
   for-profit educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr.Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and
   Zia Khan to help promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging tech
   fields like</p>

   <ul>
    <li>Cloud Native Computing</li>
    <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
    <li>Blockchain</li>
    <li>Internet Of Things</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Cloud Native Computing:</h2>
   <p>The <strong>Cloud Native Computing</strong> program prepares the students to program in open source
   technologies like,<strong> Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, Javascript, Node.js, React and React Native</strong>
   while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development
   techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.</p>

   <h2>Artificial Intelligence:</h2>
   <p>The <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI
   technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <strong>Phyton, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow
   2.0 and Flask,</strong> and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with real-life
   examples of modern day AI in practice.</p>

   <h2>Blockchain:</h2>
   <p>The main emphasis <strong>Blockchain</strong> program is to understand the blockchains like <strong>Ethereum
   and Hyperiedger (Fabric),</strong> and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, Javascript on
   frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development od Distributed Apps
   (DApps), frameworks like web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanging of Blockchain-as-a-
   service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.</p>

   <h2>Internet Of Things:</h2>
   <P>The <strong>Internet of things</strong> program introduces the students to open source development
   technologies like <strong>Rust, Embedded Rust, Web Assembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant and Kubernetes</strong> while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for loT Edge, loT
   Cloud, and voice computing fpr device control.</p>
